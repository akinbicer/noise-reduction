# Noise Reduction in MATLAB using Butterworth Band-Pass Filtering

This MATLAB script demonstrates noise reduction in audio files using a Butterworth band-pass filter. It reads an audio file specified by the user, applies the filter to remove unwanted noise, and saves the cleaned audio and statistics in separate folders.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (R2018a or later)
- Audio System Toolbox

## Installation

1. Install MATLAB R2018a or later.
2. Install the required MATLAB Toolbox: Audio System Toolbox.
3. Download or copy the project files to your computer.

## Usage

1. Open `main.m` in MATLAB.
2. You will see a prompt in the command line saying "Enter the path of the input audio file:". Enter the path of the audio file you want to process.
3. The project will process the audio file, save the cleaned audio in the "cleaned" folder, and save statistics in the "statistics" folder as a JSON file.
